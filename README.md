# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

I followed Paul's Hudson tutorial to build a simple IOS travel app. The app shows the different fun facts about a particular place such as country, a touristic site, location etc, and allows navigation using a map to see more places. The project reads from assets/json files with the info about places and displays them accordingly with some navigation. I did a few things here and there to play with the tutorial some more such as randomizing the front place to display, changing direction names, switching var and let etc. 

Include some screenshots.

## What you learned
I learned the use of "!" as a defensive coding style to help in case something important like reading from an asset file fails, the crash then whole app. There are pros and cons, but it was cool learning that. I also noticed some similarities of swift with other object oriented languages like java, in the use of classes and object. I also learned how and when to use class vs. struct structures, let vs. static let etc.

## What worked & what didn't
What worked was replicating the project after following the tutorial. What didn't work was adding the tips section, where the files used were not compatible with my version of the software. I plan to look more into this.

## Acknowledgments
To implement this small project, I followed the tutorial by Paul Hudson, which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP-SQXTtWhY&t=9054s, and the associated repo: https://github.com/twostraws/Trekr. I modified the project a bit just as a way of experimenting more with swift and ios.
