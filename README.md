# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

I followed Paul's Hudson tutorial to build a simple IOS travel app. The app shows the different fun facts about a particular place such as country, a touristic site, location etc, and allows navigation using a map to see more places. 

Include some screenshots.

## What you learned

What worked was replicating the project after following the tutorial. What didn't work was adding the tips section, where the files used were not compatible with my version of the software. I plan to look more into this.
